# POC_CVE-2024-23897

## Description
This script is a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates the exploitation of CVE-2024-23897, a vulnerability that allows reading arbitrary files on the affected Jenkins controllers, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

## Usage
To use this PoC, run the script with the URL of the target Jenkins instance and the file path you want to read as arguments:

```bash
python POC_CVE-2024-23897.py -u http://<target_url> -f <file_path> [--debug]
```

Replace `<target_url>` with the URL of the Jenkins instance and `<file_path>` with the path to the file you want to read. Use the `--debug` flag to print detailed request and response data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Network access to the target Jenkins instance

## Disclaimer
This script is for educational and legitimate security testing purposes only. Usage of this script for attacking targets without prior mutual consent is illegal.
